  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Give up implementing incomplete filtering system.
      Instead, you can use nice modules on CPAN, such as JSON::Path
      which allows you to search complicated data structure.
      The following instance methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#date_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS#html_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper#run_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::GameArchives#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournInfo#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournEntrants#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournGames#add_filter

    - Give up implementing imperfect class-building system.
      The following class methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#mk_accessors
        * WWW::GoKGS#make_accessor
        * WWW::GoKGS#accessor_name_for
        * WWW::GoKGS#builder_name_for
        * WWW::GoKGS#known_paths

      Besides, the following instance methods become read-only:

        * WWW::GoKGS#game_archives
        * WWW::GoKGS#top_100
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_list
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_info
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_entrants
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_games

      In addition, the following instance methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#set_scraper

    - Sorry for your inconvenience. I decided to commit the terrible changes
      listed above to make this distribution maintainable.

0.14 Jun 26th, 2014

  - Add the following instance methods:
      * can_scrape
      * each_scraper
  - Add the following class methods:
      * known_paths

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Scraper objects are not built lazily anymore,
      but are built when WWW::GoKGS object is created
    - Must pass a path included by known_paths() to mk_accessors()
    - #user_agent doesn't overwrite #user_agent attributes of
      all the scraper objects as a side effect anymore. You have to overwrite
      them explicitly by yourself.

0.13 Jun 24th, 2014

  - WWW::GoKGS#user_agent, #from, #date_filter and #html_filter
    become 'rw'
  - Add WWW::GoKGS#agent

0.12 Jun 23rd, 2014

  - WWW::GoKGS#user_agent defaults to LWP::RobotUA
    to avoid overloading the KGS server, while you can still set
    your own user agent.
  - Add #from which is used to construct LWP::RobotUA object.
    This attribute is required.
